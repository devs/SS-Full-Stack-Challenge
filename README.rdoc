== StackSocial Full Stack Challenge... App

A simple Rails app satisfies the requirements of StackSocial's {Full Stack Challenge}[http://www.https://github.com/stacksocial/code_tests/tree/master/fullstack]

It makes requests to the Twiter API, then caches and parses them, among other things.

To run this yourself, clone, then set your Twitter consumer_key and consumer_secret env variables.
